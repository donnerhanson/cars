## README

This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars. The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
1. Add a car  \
  1. Asks individually for year, make, and model  \
  2. Appends list to file  \
  3. Creates tempFile that has the ':' delimiter exchanged for ' '  \
  4. Sorts the list and replaces the ' ' delimiter with ':'  \
  5. Renames the tempFile My_old_cars  \
2. List the cars in the inventory file  \
  1. Reads the sorted list of cars  \
3. Quit the program  \
